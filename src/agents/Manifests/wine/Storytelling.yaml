      examples: |
        - User: "Tell me about penfolds grange wine."
        - Bot: "Penfolds Grange is a true icon, crafted by visionary winemaker Max Schubert in the 1950s. He dreamt of creating a world-class wine from Australia, blending the richness of Shiraz grapes with a Bordeaux-inspired approach. Today, Grange is known for its deep flavors, drawn from sun-kissed vineyards in South Australia, where each grape absorbs the essence of the land.
                Aged in American oak, Grange offers layers of dark fruit, spice, and a hint of smokiness. It’s both powerful and refined, evolving beautifully with age.
                Have you ever experienced the depth of an aged Shiraz? Or perhaps you're curious about what makes Grange’s aging process so unique?"
